# Description
Dive into the pulse-pounding action of Rampage, an exciting Unity game that blends relentless gameplay with enhanced visual effects. In this Unity project, I've created an engaging experience with object pooling, dynamic difficulty, advanced lighting, post-processing, and animations strategically enhanced by animation events. These events trigger specific points in the zombies' attack animations, adding a layer of strategy to the player's survival. Key features include:

- Object pooling for smooth tile management, ensuring a consistent gaming flow.
- Player-controlled movement with the W, A, S, D keys in a dynamically shifting environment.
- A horde of over 40 zombie variations, each with unique animations and attack mechanisms.
- A targeting system allowing the player to aim at the closest zombie using sphere gizmos.
- Implementation of Navmesh AI for realistic zombie movement and dynamic encounters.
- Progressive difficulty scaling, increasing the challenge as the level accelerates after every three tiles.
- Navmesh bridges facilitating zombie movement across tiles for strategic encounters.
- A destroyer script managing the horde size, maintaining optimal performance.
- Advanced lighting and post-processing effects for a visually immersive game environment.
- Animations enhanced by strategic animation events, shaping the dynamics of zombie attacks.


# Gameplay
Survive the escalating chaos in Rampage as you navigate through shifting tiles using W, A, S, D. Animated zombies relentlessly pursue you, and sphere gizmos help detect and target the nearest zombie. Stay on your toes as animation events dynamically shape the flow of zombie attacks, adding strategy to your survival tactics.
